# UnityMazeSolver
Hi, I'm David

This simple unity project is for creating and solving a maze.
Began developing after watching a maze generation gif on a website.
Since this is my first project on Unity, I used it to learn how to work with Unity, and how to use a backtracking algorithm, so don't expect any fancy code.

Maze solving works by using a simple backtracking algorithm. 
The UI is very simple, and allows you to generate any maze of a given width and height as long as it's under 500 cells.
After watching the maze generation it allows you to visualize the maze being solved.

Do whatever you want with the code.
